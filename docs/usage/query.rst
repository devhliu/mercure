==========

Mercure Query enables pulling series and studies from various servers. It is an alternative to the "push" workflows that the Mercure receiver enables.

To query a node, you must have at least one target with type set to "Pull" or "Both." Other targets will not appear in the dropdown list. 

A query requires one or more accession numbers to start with, separated by commas. Mercure will attempt to query every study that has that one of the listed accessions.
